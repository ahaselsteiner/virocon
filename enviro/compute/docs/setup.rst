Setup
*****

To setup X, you first need to install a Python 3.6 environment.
See e.g. `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_.

You then have to make sure the requirements are met. A list of necessary python packages can be found in the *requirements.txt* in the repositories root directory. You can install all these packages by running::

    pip install -r /path/to/repo/requirements.txt

(Make sure to replace ``/path/to/repo`` by the actual path.)

You can then copy the folder *compute* from the repositories root to your working directory and import it as a common python package.
