ViroCon is an easy-to-use web-based software to compute environmental contours.

## About
ViroCon helps you to design marine structures, which need to withstand load 
combinations based on wave, wind and current. It lets you define extreme 
environmental conditions with a given return period using the environmental 
contour method.

The following methods are available:
* Fitting a probabilistic model to measurement data using maximum likelihood
estimation
* Defining a probabilistic model with the conditonal modeling approach (CMA) 
* Computing an environmental contour using either the
  * inverse first order reliability method (IFORM) or the
  * highest density contour (HDC) method

ViroCon is written in Python 3.6.4 and uses the package 
[viroconcom](https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/viroconcom) for 
statistical computations.
